# DMRadon
Tools for calculating the Radon Transform, for use in the analysis of Directional Dark Matter Direct Detection


Most of the functions accept the following option arguments:
- `vlag = 220.0`, the speed of the lab with respect to the DM halo (the 'lag speed')  
- `sigv = 156.0`, the standard deviation of the Maxwell-Boltzmann  
- `vesc = 533.0`, the escape speed in the Galactic frame
